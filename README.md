- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g. Clean your room, Close the door, Take out the trash)
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
